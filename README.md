# Covid-19 Tracker Map

We are building a crowdsourced Covid-19 map for cities where the community can report geolocalized information related to the virus (cases, news, briefings) and visualize it on the map.

The application will be divided in three components: a [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) backend, a [React](https://reactjs.org/) frontend, and a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) mobile application.

Currently we don't have plans of hosting our own version although we might in the future. We are doing this for fun and to create a space of collaborative development on a subject that affect us all, so anyone is free to host their own version as well.

## Description

The application will show a map with information about cases, news and briefings related to Covid-19. We need to be careful not to allow the identification of a person or place.

Anyone will be able to create an account to post reports that can be verified by a group of people called the validators.

Government and health institutions will have their own access to post briefings.

Finally, there are administrators who can change the permissions of the users.

## Contributing

We need help writing code (implementing features, fixing bugs, etc.), design, documentation and discussing subjects that can help the project succeed. Check out the issues page for specific tasks.

Something important we need help with right now is to configure Docker compose so that anyone can run the backend and frontend easily.

## Credits

The initiative came from Sebastián Zapata, who is writing the backend. Germán Escobar helped define the initial scope and is writing the frontend.
